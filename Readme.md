#**Automatic Speech Recognition System for Kazakh-Russian code-switched speech**

##Overview##
Due to the prevalence of bilingualism among Kazakh speakers, code-switching to Russian is common in Kazakh speech. That presents a challenge for monolingual Kazakh-language ASR systems that struggle
to transcribe the embedded Russian words.
Code-switching (also referred to as code-mixing [2]) is a practice of alternating languages within an utterance that is common in bilingual and multilingual The dominant language in code-switched speech is often referred communities.
to as the matrix language, while the language whose elements are inserted into
the dominant one is referred to as the embedded language [3]. Since it mostly
occurs in informal conversations [4], difficulty of recognition of code-switched
speech is compounded by the difficulty of conversational speech recognition.
Although most state-of-the-art ASR systems are monolingual, the impact of
code-switching on ASR performance has recently sparked research interest
